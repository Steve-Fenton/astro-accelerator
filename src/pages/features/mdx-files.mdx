export const example = 'This text originates from a variable in the .mdx file';

We are experimenting with `.mdx` file support. In general, these files work with Astro Accelerator just like normal markdown files, except you can use MDX syntax inside them. This page has been authored as an `.mdx` page as an example.

:::div{.note}
Don't use default layouts *if you import markdown files into `.mdx` files*. Astro will process your layout for all includes, which wil result in unexpected additional components rendered throughout the page.
:::

The text below is an example of MDX variables:

{example}

You can use variables using `{variableName}` syntax.

## Adding MDX to Astro

Install the extension:

```bash
npm install @astrojs/mdx
```

Update your `astro.config.mjs` file:

```javascript
import mdx from '@astrojs/mdx';

export default defineConfig({
    integrations: [mdx()],
    // ...
});
```

## Known issues

If you use variables in headings, the table of contents and bookmark address reflect the variable name rather than the text that will be displayed on the page
